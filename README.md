# MLE_Exercise

This is my first attempt at a Machine Learning Engineer exercise. 

I was given a Jupyter Notebook containing a report from a Data Scientists along with instructions on how the model I build should perform. I was also proveded train and test csv data.

I created a model object file to train a logistic regression model. I was to clean and prepare the data and predict new values. I wrote a server file to query this model for a different team to request a prediction when sent with data. This was all placed in a Docker file to be spun up as needed along with a bash file to start the docker container. 

A few test cases were written along with a report of decisions I made.
